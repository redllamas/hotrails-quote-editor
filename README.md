# README

This repo follows Alexandre Ruban's Turbo Rails tutorial at https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails.
(Thanks Alexandre!).

I completed the tutorial in 4-5 evenings after the kids had gone to bed, and got a lot out of it.

### Pros

* The code provided was clearly documented and well-formatted, so little room for error
* The example app was a non-trivial quote editor with quotes > dates > line items, which allowed lots of opportunities to learn Turbo
* The app introduced fallback code when Turbo is not (or cannot) be used

### Cons

* There were a few examples where the code provided did not work as expected and a little trial and error correction was required
* A Github repository of the final "official" code could have been provided for final confirmation

All in all, pretttty pretty good tutorial with the potential to expand it.
e.g. Could add quote ActionMailer functionality.

I also took the opportunity to try and complete this tutorial with neovim.
I found adding the LazyVim config + emmet-ls immediately made neovim more useful.

To anyone else about to try the tutorial, good luck!
